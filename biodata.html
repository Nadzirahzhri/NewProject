        <strong>Nur Ain Nadzirah</strong>, 20 years old <i>(born June 24, 2004)</i>. A person of Cancer sign of zodiaq.
        For some people would call me Ain and some would call me Nad. I am the first child among three siblings, 
        the sister of one younger sister and one younger brother, and I am still blessed with my parents.
        I am from Kuala Lumpur and was born at <font color="blue">Pusrawi Hospital, Kuala Lumpur.</font>

        Since childhood, I have been raised in Kuala Lumpur and often spent school holidays with my cousins in my grandparents’ 
        village in <font color="blue"> Kuala Kangsar, Perak.</font> I prioritize my family as to express my gratefulness for giving me a wonderful family. 
        We have been very close, reminding me that “everyone goes, but family stays.” Without my family, I would not have 
        reached this proud stage in my life, as I need their strong support to face all challenges.
        
        I attended Pasti Al-Hilmi Kindergarten (2009-2010), then primary school at SK Taman Seri Rampai (2011-2016), and 
        secondary school at SMK Zon R1 Wangsa Maju (2017-2022). I once aspired to become a psychologist, but perhaps my fortune
        lies in something I never imagined. Now, I am pursuing a diploma in Information Management at UiTM Rembau, Negeri Sembilan,
        for two and a half years. As long as it does not darken my future, I will continue to try even if I complain. Believe that 
        all efforts will bear fruit and will never betray us.

        In addition, I can draw and color well since I was an art student in secondary school. Beautiful things soothe my heart. 
        Sometimes I also enjoy baking as a hobby because I love desserts. Since childhood, my mother has introduced me to the 
        world of baking. It is a blessing I am most grateful for, as I can create what I envision and it’s a must for me to get 
        comments from my younger sibling because “kids are more honest.” At the same time, drawing and baking help relieve stress, 
        which is important for maintaining good emotions and staying happy.

        From what I have shared, I am dedicated, loving, and responsible in my life. I also aspire to always be someone who 
        radiates positivity and remains humble in all situations. Mira Filzah once said on the Nona program in 2023, 
        “Those who are always humble will not easily be belittled by others.” Mira Filzah is one of the celebrities I 
        admire for her character and achievements since secondary school.

        <strong><font size="5">Inspirational quotes</font></strong>
            <blackquotes> 
              "Have courage and be kind"
               <blockquotes>
                               - Cinderella
               </blockquotes>
            </blackquotes>
        However, everything I am doing and striving for is just the first step before entering adulthood. There is still 
        so much I have yet to achieve and learn to make my parents proud and to be a good example for others, especially 
        my siblings. The knowledge of God is vast, exceeding the oceans, and my knowledge is but a drop in the vast ocean.

        That’s all from me, thank you for reading!

      <h3 style="text-align:justify ; padding: 16; font-family: FancyFont, cursive; font-size: small  ; src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/cinzel/v12/8vIW7w4dZcsFmBwMkzMWOIKArw.ttf);">  
        <p>
        Since childhood, I have been raised in Kuala Lumpur and often spent school holidays with my cousins in my grandparents‚Äô village in <font color="blue"> Kuala Kangsar, Perak.
        </font> I prioritize my family as to express my gratefulness for giving me a wonderful family. We have been very close, reminding me that ‚Äúeveryone goes, but family stays.‚Äù 
        Without my family, I would not have reached this proud stage in my life, as I need their strong support to face all challenges.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I attended Pasti Al-Hilmi Kindergarten (2009-2010), then primary school at SK Taman Seri Rampai (2011-2016), and secondary school at SMK Zon R1 Wangsa Maju 
        (2017-2022). I once aspired to become a psychologist, but perhaps my fortune lies in something I never imagined. Now, I am pursuing a diploma in Information 
        Management at UiTM Rembau, Negeri Sembilan, for two and a half years. As long as it does not darken my future, I will continue to try even if I complain. 
        Believe that all efforts will bear fruit and will never betray us.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I can draw and color well since I was an art student in secondary school. Beautiful things soothe my heart. Sometimes I also enjoy baking as a 
        hobby because I love desserts. Since childhood, my mother has introduced me to the world of baking. It is a blessing I am most grateful for, as I can create 
        what I envision and it‚Äôs a must for me to get comments from my younger sibling because ‚Äúkids are more honest.‚Äù At the same time, drawing and baking help 
        relieve stress, which is important for maintaining good emotions and staying happy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        From what I have shared, I am dedicated, loving, and responsible in my life. I also aspire to always be someone who radiates positivity and remains humble 
        in all situations. The reminder from Mira Filzah, host of Nona program on TV3 once said, ‚ÄúThose who are always humble will not easily be belittled by others.‚Äù Mira Filzah is also
        one of the celebrities I admire for her character and achievements since secondary school and being one of the key to keep being humble in what ever you are.
        </p>
        <br> 
        <p>
        However, everything I am doing and striving for is just the first step before entering adulthood. There is still so much I have yet to achieve and learn to 
        make my parents proud and to be a good example for others, especially my siblings. The knowledge of God is vast, exceeding the oceans, and my knowledge is 
        only a drop in the vast ocean.
